# Search-term-generator-for-Genome-sequencing

The human genome is made up of 3 billion letters made from A, G, C, and T characters. Genome sequencing helps scientists find genes more easily and quickly. For this purpose, the genome structure is searched with k-mer strings (substrings with k length). The run time of such a search can be reduced, if the neighborhood of the strings can be used as the search term, instead of each of the k-mer's terms. The project generates the neighborhood of a string by setting a hamming distance of d.
